            <h2>The Origin Story</h2>
            <p><em>Posted on October 7, 2025</em></p>

            <p>The Reason This Website Exists....</p>

            <div class="full-content">
                <h3>Hello there!</h3>

                <p>Hey there! Welcome to my first blog post! You may be wondering, why did I start this website? For fun? For attention? Actually, no. There's a lot more context to how and why I ended up here....</p>

                <h3>The start of everything</h3>
                

                <p>As a kid, I struggled in general. Even the moment of birth was difficult. I was born early due to complications, and the first few years of my life were filled with chronic health issues. Instead of a happy first day with my parents, I was taken to a hospital, located in a city an hour away since I was so tiny. Despite this, I grew up to be a very happy child. My optimism grew as I finally recovered from my fragile state at age seven. I had friends, supportive adults and a good reputation in school. I was a pretty confident child. Shy? Yes. Insecure? Not really. After a certain event at age nine however, everything changed.</p> 

                <h3>Going downhill</h3>
                <p>My issues flared up once again; but in other strange ways. Instead of chronic illnesses, I developed very baffling symptoms such as rarely being able to talk outside of home, panic attacks, a bad self image and much more. I now know this partly a trauma response, but little me didn't know that of course. By age twelve, I was in my worst state. My memories from that time are quite blurry. I just vaguely remember being in my bedroom, thinking: 'What has happened to me?' Looking at childhood photos just greatly pained me; it reminded me of a time where things were okay. When I wasn't alone, confused and lost. As time progressed, I began forgetting who my true self was. </p>

                <p>At one point, a person I knew from childhood came to visit from her home country. I didn't have contact with her for the past ten years, so I didn't really know if she stayed the same or if she was a totally different person with different values. But because I was so distraught, I just said everything I was feeling. Anything that came to mind. Did she care? I am not sure. Probably not. We do not currently have contact.</p>

                <h3>The light at the end of the tunnel</h3>
                <p>I guess in the end me rambling on did something; later on that year.... I had a dream. A dream of how I finally made it out of my comfort zone. I am not going to spoil what the dream contained just yet. Although it was my subconscious probably sorting out the words I impulsively said to that person, it was life changing, because from then on.... I started getting better. The drive and the motivation finally emerged and gave me the strength to pull through.</p>

                <p>Shortly after, I found out I was autistic, and later on several other things. It pretty much explained why I had so many differences and 'quirks'. The event pretty much was a blessing in disguse; since that led my symptoms to flare up and finally be caught by doctors. I fought for several years to gain the majority of my inner peace back</p>

                <p>Let's fast forward to a few years later. I was sixteen, and unfortunately hospitalized for a severe infection I contracted. Funny enough, after I was released, I was bored as anything, so I opened my laptop searching random things. I searched 'how to make a website' as a joke, but little did I know....that was the start of something big. I wanted desperately to help others with their own difficulties and hardships ever since I started getting back on my feet, but I wasn't sure how. I helped my peers at school with a multitude of things, but I yearned to expand. That's when I made my first website with a website builder. Long story short, everyone was amazed, in awe and in excitement. My classmates and teachers happily spread it around the school premisis, and it wasn't long until I gained international website traffic. Shortly after, I finally got on social media, which helped it even further.</p>

                <h3>Getting knocked down</h3>
                <p>Since I didn't expect for my website to be such a hit, I soon moved on another website builder for increased flexibility. But unfortunately, something came my way. Not long after it was released, a person I blocked, who I am not going to name, invaded it. No, it wasn't hacked. Just invaded and crossed boundaries. Due to the website being on a website builder, I had limited control of who comes in and who goes out. So, I did what I had to do to protect myself - I deleted the website.</p>

                <h3>The final push</h3>
                <p>I went without a website for several months, convincing myself social media was enough. Luckily, one my friend noticed the website inactive, and that compelled me to tell her the reason. She urged me to not give up. I soon set to work. I played around with blogging apps and other website builders, but I settled down to making my very own custom website - from scratch.</p> 

                <p>Now, I have my very own website, and I am so glad I made it, depsite all obstacles. I really hope you stick around and enjoy future content!</p>
